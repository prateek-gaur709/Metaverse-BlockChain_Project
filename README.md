# Metaverse-BlockChain_Project
It is a Blockchain project.Built using Node Js, Solidity ,Ganache ,metamask and truffle framework, this application provides any user ,with a metamask account, to buy buildings ( cost set to 1 ether) in a metaverse created using Three.js

Metaverse is a decentralized application (DAPP) that can operate through the use of smart contracts, that run on a decentralized computing, blockchain or other distributed ledger system. 

- For ease of testing, used Ganache, to build a Private chain and push the smart contract on this 
Private chain, so that the Private chain simulates the situation of the Public chain(Ethereum). 
- The user interface seen by the user is a web page. The server side of the web page is made using 
the truffle suite, which was provided by node.js. 
- Used Web3.js as the link between the smart contract and the user interface. 
-Created 3d-objects, like buildings, using Three.js in the metaverse. These buildings can be purchased 
by users having Metamask account (cost set to 1 eth). 

#Note - Master branch contains the code files.
